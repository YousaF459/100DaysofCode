ðŸš§ Currently, I'm working on the data integration for the table section of my FTMO website frontend clone. Here are some key points of my work:

Dynamic Currency Display:

Implemented dynamic display of different currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, CZK, CAD, AUD, CHF) to enhance user experience.
Financial Information:

Incorporated balance details for various accounts, providing users with a quick overview of their financial status.
Trading Comparison:

Designed a "Quick Comparison" section outlining essential steps (Step 1: FTMO Challenge, Step 2: Verification, Step 3: FTMO Trader) for users to follow.
Flexible Trading Periods:

Allowed users to view and compare different trading periods (Unlimited) for each step, adapting to their unique preferences.
Risk Management:

Added data for maximum daily loss, maximum loss, profit target, and refundable fee, ensuring users have a clear understanding of risk and rewards.
