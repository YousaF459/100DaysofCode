ðŸš€ Exciting Update: Completed the Homepage for FTMO Frontend Clone! ðŸš€


I'm thrilled to share a major milestone in my #100DaysOfCode journey. ðŸŽ‰ I've successfully completed the homepage for my FTMO Frontend Clone project! ðŸš€

I undertook the creation of the FTMO Frontend Clone homepage as a focused project to rigorously test and enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The primary goal was to replicate the visual and interactive elements of the FTMO homepage, providing a comprehensive showcase of my front-end development capabilities.
